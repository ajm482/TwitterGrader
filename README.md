# TwitterGrader
TwitterGrader was created to practice using REST web services. TwitterGrader uses OAuth 2.0 to access a Twitter user's timeline and pull the most recent 30 tweets from that account. The account is assessed and then graded using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, which counts the percentage of polysylabic words per sentance.
